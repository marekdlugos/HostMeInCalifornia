                <p>Now I am studying at High school focusing on Information and network technology.</p>
                <p>The main goal of my school year in CA is graduation with diploma and then I want to get scholarship at a good university.</p>

                <h2>Some words about me...</h2>
                <p>I live in small town in the East of Slovakia. I think I am proactive, open to new people and ideas, intelligent and always optimistic young boy. I have loving parents and great siblings. Since my childhood I’m very interested in high tech and basketball. I have also active interest in learning and spread my skills and knowledge.</p>
                <h2>I love these three things</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Computers</h3>
                        <p>I am very interested in all kind of stuff around the computers. But the most I like creating web sites and working with videos and photos.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Basketball</h3>
                        <p>My biggest love is basketball. I play basketball in our school team and I have strong passion to work hard on my basketball skills in the US.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Traveling</h3>
                        <p>Discovering places and enjoying beauty of the nature and cities is what I like. My secret wish is to explore all famous places and national parks in the US and to see the world.</p>

                </ul>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Mrs. E. Čulková, my english teacher</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>I have known Marek for 2 years, he is a student of our school and I am really happy to have him in my group.</p>
                        <p>He is a very smart student, responsible and reliable in doing his assignments. He is a creative person with rich imagination and a sense of humour.</p>
                        <p>His essays are always full of new ideas and unussual and unique opinions.</p>
                        <p>On his age he is mature young gentleman, very polite in his manners. He is popular with his schoolmates, always willing to help those who are in troubles.</p>
                        <p>For his positive attitude to  his duties and for his good personality traits he gets on very well with other teachers as well.</p>
                        <p>I strongly recommend him to any American family because I am sure he will be an asset for all its members.</p></dd>
